(ns otplike.supervisor
  "Provides a supervisor, a process that supervises other processes
  called child processes.

  A child process can either be another supervisor or a worker
  process. Worker processes are normally implemented using `gen_server`
  behavior. Supervisors are used to build a hierarchical process
  structure called a supervision tree, a nice way to structure a
  fault-tolerant application. For more information, see
  [Supervisor Behaviour][1] in OTP Design Principles.

  A supervisor expects the definition of which child processes to
  supervise to be specified in the return value of a supervisor's
  function.

  Unless otherwise stated, all functions of this namespaces fail if the
  specified supervisor does not exist or if bad arguments are specified.

  ### Supervision Principles

  The supervisor is responsible for starting, stopping, and monitoring
  its child processes. The basic idea of a supervisor is that it must
  keep its child processes alive by restarting them when necessary.

  The children of a supervisor are defined as a list of child
  specifications. When the supervisor is started, the child processes
  are started in order from left to right according to this list. When
  the supervisor terminates, it first terminates its child processes in
  reversed start order, from right to left.

  The supervisor properties are defined by the supervisor flags. The
  spec definition for the supervisor flags is as follows:

  ```
  (spec/def ::intensity nat-int?)
  (spec/def ::period pos-int?)
  (spec/def ::strategy
    #{:one-for-all
      :one-for-one
      :rest-for-one})

  (spec/def ::sup-flags
  (spec/keys
    :opt-un [::strategy
             ::intensity
             ::period]))
  ```

  A supervisor can have one of the following restart strategies
  specified with the strategy key in the above map:

  `:one-for-one` - If one child process terminates and is to be
  restarted, only that child process is affected. This is the default
  restart strategy.

  `:one-for-all` - If one child process terminates and is to be
  restarted, all other child processes are terminated and then all child
  processes are restarted.

  `:rest-for-one` - If one child process terminates and is to be
  restarted, the 'rest' of the child processes (that is, the child
  processes after the terminated child process in the start order) are
  terminated. Then the terminated child process and all child processes
  after it are restarted.

  To prevent a supervisor from getting into an infinite loop of child
  process terminations and restarts, a maximum restart intensity is
  defined using two integer values specified with keys `:intensity` and
  `:period` in the above map. Assuming the values `max-r` for
  `:intensity` and `max-t` for `:period`, then, if more than `max-r`
  restarts occur within `max-t` seconds, the supervisor terminates all
  child processes and then itself. The termination reason for the
  supervisor itself in that case will be `:shutdown`. intensity defaults
  to `1` and period defaults to `5`.

  The spec definition of a child specification is as follows:

  ```
  (spec/def ::timeout (spec/or :ms nat-int? :inf #{:infinity}))
  (spec/def ::args (spec/coll-of any?))

  (spec/def ::id any?)
  (spec/def ::start (spec/tuple fn? ::args))
  (spec/def ::restart #{:permanent :transient :temporary})
  (spec/def ::shutdown
  (spec/or :brutal-kill #{:brutal-kill}
           :timeout ::timeout))
  (spec/def ::type #{:worker :supervisor})

  (spec/def ::child-spec
  (spec/keys
    :req-un [::id
             ::start]
    :opt-un [::restart
             ::shutdown
             ::type]))
  ```

  `:id` is used to identify the child specification internally by the
  supervisor.

  `:start` defines the function call used to start the child process.
  It must be a function-arguments tuple `[f args]` used as
  `(apply f args)`.

  The start function must create a child process and link to it, and
  must return `[:ok child-pid]` or `[:ok child-pid info]`, where `info`
  is any value that is ignored by the supervisor. The function is
  allowed to return async value wrapping the actual return.

  If something goes wrong, the function can also return an error tuple
  `[:error error]`.

  Notice that the `gen-server/start-link` functions fulfill the above
  requirements.

  `:restart` defines when a terminated child process must be
  restarted. A `:permanent` child process is always restarted. A
  `:temporary` child process is never restarted (even when the
  supervisor's restart strategy is `:rest-for-one` or `one-for-all` and
  a sibling's death causes the temporary process to be terminated). A
  `:transient` child process is restarted only if it terminates
  abnormally, that is, with another exit reason than `:normal`,
  `:shutdown`, or `[:shutdown reason]`. The `:restart` key is optional
  and defaults to `:permanent`.

  `:shutdown` defines how a child process must be
  terminated. `:brutal-kill` means that the child process is
  unconditionally terminated using `(process/exit child-pid :kill)`. An
  integer time-out value means that the supervisor tells the child
  process to terminate by calling `(process/exit child-pid :shutdown)`
  and then wait for an exit signal with reason `:shutdown` back from the
  child process. If no exit signal is received within the specified
  number of milliseconds, the child process is unconditionally
  terminated using `(process/exit child-id :kill)`.

  If the child process is another supervisor, the shutdown time is to be
  set to `:infinity` to give the subtree ample time to shut down. It is
  also allowed to set it to `:infinity`, if the child process is a
  worker.

  > **Warning!**
  > Be careful when setting the shutdown time to
  > `:infinity` when the child process is a worker. Because, in this
  > situation, the termination of the supervision tree depends on the
  > child process, it must be implemented in a safe way and its cleanup
  > procedure must always return.

  Notice that all child processes implemented using the standard
  behaviors (`gen-server`) automatically adhere to the shutdown
  protocol.

  The `:shutdown` key is optional. If it is not specified, it defaults
  to `5000` if the child is of type `:worker` and it defaults to
  `:infinity` if the child is of type `:supervisor`.

  `:type` specifies if the child process is a supervisor or a worker.
  The `:type` key is optional and defaults to `:worker`.

  "Creates a supervisor process as part of a supervision tree.
  For example, the function ensures that the supervisor is linked to
  the calling process (its supervisor).

  The created supervisor process calls `sup-fn` to find out about
  restart strategy, maximum restart intensity, and child processes.
  To ensure a synchronized startup procedure, `start-link!` does not
  return until `sup-fn` has returned and all child processes have been
  started. `sup-fn` is allowed to return async value wrapping the actual
  return.

  If `sup-name` is provided, the supervisor is registered locally as
  `sup-name`.

  `args` is a vector of the arguments to `sup-fn`.

  If the supervisor and its child processes are successfully created
  (that is, if all child process start functions return
  `[ok, child-pid]`), the function returns `[ok, pid]`, where `pid` is
  the pid of the supervisor.

  If there already exists a process with the specified `sup-name`,
  the function retunrs `[:error reason]`.

  If `sup-fn` fails or returns an incorrect value, this function returns
  `[:error ([:bad-return-value 'init ret] :as reason)]` , where `ret`
  is the returned value, and the supervisor terminates with the same
  reason.

  If any child process start function fails or returns an error tuple
  or an erroneous value, the supervisor first terminates all already
  started child processes with reason `:shutdown` and then terminate
  itself and returns `[:error, [:shutdown reason]]`."
